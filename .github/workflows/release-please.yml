# Release Please workflow
# https://github.com/googleapis/release-please-action
#
# This workflow:
# 1. Runs on every push to main
# 2. Analyzes conventional commits since last release
# 3. Creates/updates a Release PR with version bump and changelog
# 4. When Release PR is merged, creates a git tag
# 5. The tag triggers the release.yml workflow to publish to crates.io
